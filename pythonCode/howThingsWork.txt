so we'll use logistic regression with X being a len(param)-1 long vector
y will be the output

logistic regression will reduce the error on the model with gradient descent
-not linear uses L2 regularization

we can use this model to get values of newly changed "param" values
-use python's sklearn, for logistic regression
